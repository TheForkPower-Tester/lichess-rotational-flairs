All images to be in *webp* format
Feel free to make some pull requests and suggest some.
Want to contribute towards these specifically yourself?
You just need to follow the steps below:

#### 1. Creating the desired flair
Make a flair, which can be created by yourself or based off a stock image, but **be mindful of licenses**

#### 2. Naming the flair (correct syntax)
The name of the file is important, it's the only metadata we have. It's made of two parts: the category, and the name.

`<category>.<multi-word-name>.webp`

The category will be used to group the flairs in the UI. It can be one of the following:
`smileys`, `people`, `nature`, `food-drink`, `activity`, `travel-places`, `objects`, `symbols`, `flags`.

The name will be used to identify the flair in the UI. It can be any string, but it should be short and descriptive.
It can only contain letters, numbers, and dashes. Descriptive names help users find the flair.

#### 3. Pull request syntax
You can upload this image into the correct directory and make a Pull request. Please include the raw png image of your webp in the description of the PR so I can review it more easily.

Thanks for contributing and taking the time to read this file.
